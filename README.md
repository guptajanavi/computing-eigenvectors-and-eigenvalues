# computing-eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues
This project focuses on comprehending and investigating various methods for computing  eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices. Additionally, it aims to compute sin- gular values and singular vectors, not only for symmetric but also non-symmetric matrices.  The methods under exploration include the QR Method, Power Method, and Deflation.
