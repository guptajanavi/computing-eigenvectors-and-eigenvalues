# Computing Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: QR method, Power method and Deflation
## Janavi Gupta and Aditi Rao
This project focuses on comprehending and investigating various methods for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices. Additionally, it aims to compute sin-
gular values and singular vectors, not only for symmetric but also non-symmetric matrices. The methods under exploration include the QR Method, Power Method, and Deflation.
Furthermore, this project delves into combining these techniques to achieve the intended results effectively.

This was made as a part of the Fall 2023 version of 21-241 (Matrices and Linear Transformations) final project at Carnegie Mellon University.
